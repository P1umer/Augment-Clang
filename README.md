# Augment-Clang
## About
This tool is designed to assist in the construction of large binary datasets in binary research work, which will be suitable for the following purposesï¼š

1. Customize optimization level.
1. Store the object files.
1. Emit source to object path mapping
## Build
Download and compile the LLVM project first:

1. The `~/LLVM` folder will store the `llvm` repo.
1. The `~/Auto_LLVM` folder will be the output dir of `llvm` compilation.
```
mkdir ~/LLVM && cd ~/LLVM
git clone https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm.git
cd llvm

cd tools
git clone https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang.git
cd ..
mkdir build && cd build

mkdir ~/Auto_LLVM
cd ~/LLVM/llvm/build
cmake -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Auto_LLVM -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=WebAssembly -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF -DCLANG_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF ..

cmake --build . --target install -- -j24
```
Clone this repo and apply the patch files after the above steps are successfully executed.
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/P1umer/Augment-Clang.git

cd ~/LLVM/llvm
patch -p1 < ~/Augment-Clang/llvm/llvm.patch
cd ~/LLVM/llvm/tools/clang
patch -p1 < ~/Augment-Clang/llvm/tools/clang/clang.patch
```
Rebuild it.
```
cd ~/LLVM/llvm/build
cmake --build . --target install -- -j24
```
If rebuild fails, check the two `REVISON` files in this repo which store hash versions of `llvm` and `clang` respectively.
## Usage
Augment-clang is easy to use. There are just two environment variables you have to set.
### 1. AUTO_COMPILE_OPTION
The value of this variable will OVERWRITE the original optimization level. For example:
```
export AUTO_COMPILE_OPTION="-O1"
```
Optional value: `["-O0","-O1","-O2","-O3","-O4","-Os","-Oz","-Ofast"]`.
### 2. AUTO_COMPILE_STORAGE_PATH
This environment variable should be set to the global path to the folder where object file copies are stored.
```
export AUTO_COMPILE_STORAGE_PATH="/tmp/copys"
```
After the compilation is completed, an additional `BIN2SRC` file that stores the sourcecode to object file path mapping info will also be generated in this folder.
### 3. Use Augment-Clang
The last step you need to do is to replace the system installed `clang` with `Augment-Clang`.
